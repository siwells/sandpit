Function to call a JMS message queue using the stompest.py library and using an RPC (request/response) communication pattern.

1. Create a virtualenv, and activate it
2. pip install stompest
3. In the config set the host:port numbers to match your JMS broker
4. Provide names of the request and response queues and the request content (which we assume is JSON and which is passed through directly)
5. Return from the function is the document posted to the response queue or None
