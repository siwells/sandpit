"""Generate random sentences from a grammar.  The grammar
consists of entries that can be written as S = 'NP VP | S and S',
which gets translated to {'S': [['NP', 'VP'], ['S', 'and', 'S']]}, and
means that one of the top-level lists will be chosen at random, and
then each element of the second-level list will be rewritten; if a symbol is
not in the grammar it rewrites as itself.   The functions generate and
generate_tree generate a string and tree representation, respectively, of
a random sentence."""
